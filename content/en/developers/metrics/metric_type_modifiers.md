A metric type is an indication of what you tried to represent with your metric and its emission source. If you refer to the [metric types][1] documentation, you can see that the COUNT and RATE metric types are really close to one another as they represent the same concept: the variation of a metric value over time, but not with the same logic:

* RATE: Normalized value variation over time (usually _per seconds_)
* COUNT: Absolute value variation over a given time interval.

Depending on your use-case and your submission method, one metric type may be more suited than the other for submission, for instance:

| Metric type submitted | Use-case                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------          | ----------                                                                                                                                                                      |
| RATE                  | You want to monitor across several hosts the amount of request received over time.                                                                                              |
| RATE                  | You have no control over the consistency of count temporal submission across your sources, hence you normalize by each individual interval to be able to compare them upstream. |
| COUNT                 | You want to count the amount of time a function is called.                                                                                                                      |
| COUNT                 | Counting the amount of revenues that have been made over a given amount of time.                                                                                                       |

But since RATE and COUNT aren't the same metric type, they don't have the same behavior/shape within Datadog graphs and monitors. In order to allow you to change on the fly between a RATE and a COUNT metric representation, Datadog has in-application modifiers functions that you can apply to your metrics within your graphs and monitor.

## In-application modifiers

The two main in-application modifiers are `as_count()` and `as_rate()`

| Modifiers | Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| `as_count()` | This functions set the operations necessary to display the given metric in COUNT form: giving you the absolute variation of a metric value over [a rollup interval][2]. Note that since it's depending on the rollup interval, [graphing a longer time interval changes your graph shape][3]. |
| `as_rate()` | This functions set the operations necessary to display the given metric in RATE form: giving you the absolute variation of a metric value per second. |

Depending on the metric type you applied them to, their behavior differ:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "COUNT" %}}

* Effect of `as_count()`:
  * Disable any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to SUM.
* Effect of `as_rate()`:
  * Disable any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to SUM
  * Divide the result post-aggregation by the sampling interval in order to normalize it: For example `[1,1,1,1].as_rate()` for rollup interval of 20s produces `[0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]`.

**Note**: that there is no normalization on very small intervals (when no time-aggregation occurs), thus the raw metric value counts are returned.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "RATE" %}}

* Effect of `as_count()`:
  * Disable any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to SUM.
  * Multiply the result post-aggregation by the sampling interval: For example `[0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05].as_count()` for rollup interval of 20s produces `[1,1,1,1]`.
* Effect of `as_rate()`:
  * Disable any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to SUM

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "GAUGE" %}}

GAUGE metric type representing the absolute and final value of a metric, `as_count()` and `as_rate()` modifiers have no effect on it.

## Modify a metric's type within Datadog

While it is not normally required, it is possible to change a metric's type in the [metric summary page][4]:

{{< img src="developers/metrics/metric_type_modifiers/metric_type.png" alt="Metric Type" responsive="true" style="width:70%;">}}

For example:

1. You have a metric `app.requests.served` that counts requests served, but accidentally submitted it via StatsD as a GAUGE. The metric's Datadog type is therefore GAUGE.

2. You wanted to submit `app.requests.served` as a StatsD COUNT metric for time aggregation. This would help answer questions like _"How many total requests were served in the past day?"_ by querying `sum:app.requests.served{*}` (this would not make sense for a GAUGE metric type.)

3. You like the name `app.requests.served` so rather than submitting a new metric name with a more appropriate COUNT type, you could change the type of `app.requests.served` by updating:
  * Your submission code, calling `dogstatsd.increment('app.requests.served', N)` after N requests are served.
  * The Datadog in-app type via the metric summary page to RATE.

This causes data submitted before the type change for `app.requests.served` to behave incorrectly because it was stored in a format to be interpreted as an in-app GAUGE (not a RATE). Data submitted after step 3 is interpreted properly.

If you are not willing to lose the historical data submitted as a GAUGE, create a new metric name with the new type, leaving the type of `app.requests.served` unchanged.

**Note**: For the AgentCheck, `self.increment` does not calculate the delta for a monotonically increasing counter; instead, it reports the value passed in at the check run. To send the delta value on a monotonically increasing counter, use `self.monotonic_count`.

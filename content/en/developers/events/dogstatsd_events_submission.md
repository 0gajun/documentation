DogStatsD can emit events to your [Datadog event stream][1]. For example, you may want to see errors and exceptions in Datadog:

```python

from datadog import statsd

def render_page():
  try:
    # Render the page...
    # ..
  except RenderError as err:
    statsd.event('Page render error!', err.message, alert_type='error')
```

## Tagging

Add tags to any event you send to DogStatsD. For example, compare the performance of two algorithms by tagging a timer metric with the algorithm version:

```python

@statsd.timed('algorithm.run_time', tags=['algorithm:one'])
def algorithm_one():
    # Do fancy things here ...

@statsd.timed('algorithm.run_time', tags=['algorithm:two'])
def algorithm_two():
    # Do fancy things (maybe faster?) here ...
```

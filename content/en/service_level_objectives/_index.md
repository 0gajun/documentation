Service Level Objectives, or SLOs, are a key part of the site reliability engineering toolkit. SLOs provide a 
framework for defining clear targets around application performance, which ultimately help teams provide a consistent 
customer experience, balance feature development with platform stability, and improve communication with internal and 
external users.

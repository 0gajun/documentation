## Overview

### Goal
Detect when unauthorized activity is detected in AWS

### Strategy
Monitor CloudTrail and detect when the error message of `AccessDenied` is returned.

### Triage & Response
1. Determine who the user was who made this API call.
2. Contact the user and see if this was an API call which was made by the user.
3. If the API call was not made by the user:
   * Rotate the user credentials and investigate what other API calls.
   * Determine what other API calls the user made which were not made by the user.

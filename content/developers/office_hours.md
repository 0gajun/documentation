## Community Code Review

Datadog runs twice monthly code reviews and office hours to assist community members who are contributing to our [open source projects](#list-of-open-source-project).  

**These sessions are held on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of each month.**

### Where

Office hours will be held in #integrations in the [Datadog Community Slack][1] ([get an invitation][2]), in conjunction with a [Google Hangout][3].

### When

* 2nd Wednesday of each month at 10:00am eastern time (2:00pm UTC).  
* 4th Wednesday of each month at 3:00pm eastern time (7:00pm UTC).

### Guidelines and Caveats

- Review and feedback during office hours is offered on a first come first served basis. We may not get to every review each week. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

- We welcome everyone from the community to join us and provide respectful and constructive feedback to their fellow members of the Datadog community. 

- These sessions are not intended as a channel for general Datadog support. We are primarily focused on discussing and reviewing `datadog-agent` integrations, and contributions to other Datadog [open source projects](#list-of-open-source-project). For product support we encourage you to reach out to [our support team directly][4].

- Sometimes a given PR maybe complex and require further offline review before we can provide feedback.

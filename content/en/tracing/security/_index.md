## Overview

The Datadog Agent and all tracing libraries have several options available to modify or discard spans.

These configuration options allow for a variety of use cases related to obfuscating or removing sensitive information from traces, as well as discarding traces from certain endpoints or matching criteria. Various options are described below.  These docs cover several common methods for configuring Tracer and Agent to achieve these security requirements.

If your fine-tuning needs aren't covered and you need assistance, reach out to [the Datadog support team][1].

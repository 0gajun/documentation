Different functions are available depending of the [Metric Type][1] to send metrics to Datadog through a custom Agent Check.

**Note**: Depending of the function used, the submission metric type and the actual metric type stored within Datadog might differ:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Count" %}}

### `monotonic_count()`

This functions is used to track a raw counter that **always increases**. You shouldn't normalize the values to a rate, or calculate the deltas before submitting, as the Agent does it for you. Samples that have a lower value than the previous sample are ignored (it usually means that the underlying raw counter has been reset). It can be called multiple times during a check's execution.

Example: Submitting samples 2, 3, 6, 7 sends 5 (i.e. 7-2) during the first check execution; then, submitting samples 10, 11 on the same `monotonic_count` sends 4 (i.e. 11-7) during the second check execution.

**Note**: Metrics submitted with this function are stored with a **COUNT** metric type in Datadog. Each value in the stored timeseries is a delta of the counter's value between samples (not time-normalized).

Find below the function usage:

```python
self. monotonic_count(name, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

| Parameter     | Type            | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                       |
| ---------     | ----            | -------- | ------------- | -----------                                                                       |
| `name`        | String          | yes      | -             | The name of the metric.                                                           |
| `value`       | float           | yes      | -             | The value for the metric.                                                         |
| `tags`        | list of strings | no       | `None`        | A list of tags to associate with this metric.                                     |
| `hostname`    | string          | no       | current host  | A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the.                        |
| `device_name` | String          | no       | `None`        | Deprecated add a tag in the form `device:<DEVICE_NAME>` to the tags list instead. |

### `count()`

This function submits the number of events that occurred during the check interval. It can be called multiple times during a check's execution, each sample being added to the value that is sent.

**Note**: Metrics submitted with this function are stored with a **COUNT** metric type in Datadog. Each value in the stored timeseries is a delta of the counter's value between samples (not time-normalized).

Find below the function usage:

```python
self. count(name, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

| Parameter     | Type            | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                       |
| ---------     | ----            | -------- | ------------- | -----------                                                                       |
| `name`        | String          | yes      | -             | The name of the metric.                                                           |
| `value`       | float           | yes      | -             | The value for the metric.                                                         |
| `tags`        | list of strings | no       | `None`        | A list of tags to associate with this metric.                                     |
| `hostname`    | string          | no       | current host  | A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the.                        |
| `device_name` | String          | no       | `None`        | Deprecated add a tag in the form `device:<DEVICE_NAME>` to the tags list instead. |

### `increment()`/`decrement()`

Those **deprecated** functions are used to modify a count of events identified by a metric key string by 1 at each call. It can be called multiple times during a check's execution, and is handled by the aggregator Counter class. If you want to increment/decrement by more than one, you must use the `count()` function.

**Note**: Metrics submitted with this function are stored with a **RATE** type in Datadog. Each value in the stored timeseries is a delta of the counter's value between samples (time-normalized by the aggregation interval which defaults to 1 for Agent checksâ€”so the value is generally the raw count value).

Find below the functions usage:

```python
self.increment(name, value=1, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

```python
self.decrement(name, value=1, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

| Parameter     | Type            | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                       |
| ---------     | ----            | -------- | ------------- | -----------                                                                       |
| `name`        | String          | yes      | -             | The name of the metric.                                                           |
| `value`       | float           | yes      | 1             | The increment/decrement value for the metric.                                     |
| `tags`        | list of strings | no       | `None`        | A list of tags to associate with this metric.                                     |
| `hostname`    | string          | no       | current host  | A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the.                        |
| `device_name` | String          | no       | `None`        | Deprecated add a tag in the form `device:<DEVICE_NAME>` to the tags list instead. |

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Gauge" %}}

### `gauge()`
This function submits the value of a metric at a given timestamp. If called multiple times during a check's execution for a metric only the last sample is used.

**Note**: Metrics submitted with this function are stored with a **GAUGE** metric type in Datadog.

Find below the function usage:

```python
self.gauge(name, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

| Parameter     | Type            | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                       |
| ---------     | ----            | -------- | ------------- | -----------                                                                       |
| `name`        | String          | yes      | -             | The name of the metric.                                                           |
| `value`       | float           | yes      | -             | The value for the metric.                                                         |
| `tags`        | list of strings | no       | `None`        | A list of tags to associate with this metric.                                     |
| `hostname`    | string          | no       | current host  | A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the.                        |
| `device_name` | String          | no       | `None`        | Deprecated add a tag in the form `device:<DEVICE_NAME>` to the tags list instead. |

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Rate" %}}

### `rate()`

This function submits the sampled raw value of your counter. You shouldn't normalize the values to a rate, or calculate the deltas before submitting, as the Agent does both for you. This function should only be called once during a check, otherwise it throws away any value that is less than a previously submitted value.

**Note**: Metrics submitted with this function are stored as a **GAUGE** metric type in Datadog. Each value in the stored timeseries is a time-normalized delta of the counter's value between samples.

Find below the function usage:

```python
self.rate(name, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

| Parameter     | Type            | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                       |
| ---------     | ----            | -------- | ------------- | -----------                                                                       |
| `name`        | String          | yes      | -             | The name of the metric.                                                           |
| `value`       | float           | yes      | -             | The value for the metric.                                                         |
| `tags`        | list of strings | no       | `None`        | A list of tags to associate with this metric.                                     |
| `hostname`    | string          | no       | current host  | A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the.                        |
| `device_name` | String          | no       | `None`        | Deprecated add a tag in the form `device:<DEVICE_NAME>` to the tags list instead. |

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Histogram" %}}

### `histogram()`

This function submits the sample of a histogram metric that occurred during the check interval. It can be called multiple times during a check's execution, each sample being added to the statistical distribution of the set of values for this metric.

**Note**: All metric aggregation produced are stored as a **GAUGE** metric type in Datadog, except the `<METRIC_NAME>.count` that is stored as a **RATE** metric type in Datadog.

Find below the function usage:

```python
self.histogram(name, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

| ---------     | ----            | -------- | ------------- | -----------                                                                       |
| `name`        | String          | yes      | -             | The name of the metric.                                                           |
| `value`       | float           | yes      | -             | The value for the metric.                                                         |
| `tags`        | list of strings | no       | `None`        | A list of tags to associate with this metric.                                     |
| `hostname`    | string          | no       | current host  | A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the.                        |
| `device_name` | String          | no       | `None`        | Deprecated add a tag in the form `device:<DEVICE_NAME>` to the tags list instead. |

## Datadog User roles
Datadog provides 3 user roles: 

* **Admins** have access to billing information, the ability to revoke API keys, removing users, and can configure read-only dashboards. They can also promote standard users to Admins.

* A **standard user** has access to view and modify all monitoring features that Datadog offers such as dashboards, monitors, events & notebooks.

* **Read only users** are created by admins and do not have access to edit within Datadog. This comes in handy when it is required to share specific read-only views with a client (or where a member of one business unit needs to share with another).

## Disable Existing Members

**NOTE:** You must be an Admin of the team to disable members*

1. Go to the [Team Page][1].
2. Hover over the avatar for the user you wish to disable. Choose **Disable** from the menu.

## What is APM?

Datadog APM provides you with deep insight into your application's performance-from automatically generated dashboards monitoring key metrics, such as request volume and latency, to detailed traces of individual requests-side by side with your logs and infrastructure monitoring.

Datadog APM is offered as an upgrade to the Pro and Enterprise plans. A free 14-day trial is available. Registered users can visit the [APM page of the Datadog application][1] to get started.

| [Service][1]  | Name of a set of processes that do the same job                     | Services are displayed on the [Datadog Services list][2] and have [out of the box performances graphs][3].                                       |
| [Resource][4] | Particular action for a service                                     | Resources are available on the [Resources list for each service][5] and have [out of the box performances graphs][6]                             |
| [Trace][7]    | Representation of a request as it flows across a distributed system | A trace can be collected in [any language][8]. Traces are found in the [Traces list for each resources][9] or in the [Trace search directly][10] |

The Log Search is the list of logs that match the selected context.

### Logs Table

The Log Search is displayed in the logs table.

Configure the logs table content according to your needs and preferences with the "Options" button. Among your custom attributes, only faceted or measures attributes are available for columns.

Log results are sorted by dateâ€”the most recent on top by default. You can also inverse-sort by date, with the least recent (within the limits of the time range) on top.

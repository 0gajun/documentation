## Authenticating requests

### Reporting access

API calls that require "reporting access" need only an API key to authenticate. The API key can be passed as a query parameter.

<pre>
/api/v1/some/service?api_key=your_api_key
</pre>

### Full access

API calls that require "full access" need both an API key and a matching (associated with the same org) application key to authenticate. The application key can also be passed as a query parameter.

<pre>
/api/v1/some/service?api_key=your_api_key&amp;application_key=your_application_key
</pre>

## API keys

Your organization has a single API key. With this key you can access a limited set of API calls that allow simple reporting. This is the only key you need when you configure the Datadog agent. You can find your organization's API key on the setup page: <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings">https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings</a>.

## Application keys

Application keys, in conjunction with your organization's API key, allow for full access to Datadog's programmatic API. Application keys are associated with individual user accounts, and a single account can have many keys. Keys are named and revokable. By creating a different key for each client, you can segment access to the API and deactivate individual segments at any time (if they go rogue!). You can manage your account's API keys from the setup page: <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings">https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings</a>.

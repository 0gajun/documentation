## Dashboard Lists

<div class="alert alert-info">

We updated our Dashboard Lists API. Documentation for the legacy API is available here:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/graphing/faq/dashboard-lists-api-doc">Dashboard Lists API doc (v1)</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

Interact with your dashboard lists through the API to make it easier to organize, find, and share all of your dashboards with your team and organization.

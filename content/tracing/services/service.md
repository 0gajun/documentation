Selecting a service on the services page leads you to the detailed service page:

## Definition

The name of a set of processes that do the same job.  
For instance, a simple web application may consist of two services: 

* A single `webapp` service and a single `database` service

While a more complex environment may break it out into 6 services: 

* 3 separate services: `webapp`, `admin`, and `query`.
* 3 separate external service:  `master-db`,  `replica-db`, and `yelp-api`.

These services are defined by the user when instrumenting their application with Datadog. This field is helpful to quickly distinguish between your different processes.

In the Datadog UI, this is the "Name" field in the above image. Â An example of setting a custom Service using Python:

## Introduction

This section explains the nuts and bolts of metricsâ€”what they are, and what they do. Whether you want to send [custom metrics][4], or just want to have a better understanding about how Datadog works, read on. If you're looking for information about the DogStatsD (which implements these metrics), see the [DogStatsD documentation][5].

### Submitting metrics

There are multiple ways to send metrics to Datadog:

1. Via the Datadog Agent directly. Learn how [to write an integration][2], or examine the [Aggregator source code][9] directly.
2. Via the DogStatsD server (bundled with the Datadog Agent) and a [client library][16].
3. Directly via Datadog's [HTTP API][10].
4. Via Dropwizard's Java [metrics][11] library with the [metrics-datadog][12] backend. Thanks to the good folks at [Vistar Media][19], [Coursera][13], and [Bazaarvoice][14] for their contributions.

### Naming metrics

There are a few rules regarding metric names:

* Must start with a letter.
* Must only contain ASCII alphanumerics, underscores, and periods.
  * Other characters, including spaces, are converted to underscores.
  * Unicode is _not_ supported.
* Must not exceed 200 characters. Fewer than 100 is preferred from a UI perspective.

Metrics reported by the Agent are in a pseudo-hierarchical dotted format (e.g. `http.nginx.response_time`). The hierarchy is neither enforced nor interpreted, but it can be used to infer things about servers (e.g. "hey, I see hostA and hostB are reporting `http.nginx.*`, those must be web frontends").

## Metric Types

The "Datadog in-app type" affects how a given metric is interpreted in query results and graph visualizations across the application. The metric type visible on the [metric summary page][20] is the Datadog in-app type. You should only change the type if you have started submitting this metric with a new type, and should be aware that changing the type may render historical data nonsensical.

In the Datadog web application there are five metric types (though one is deprecated):

* COUNT
* COUNTER (deprecated)
* DISTRIBUTION
* GAUGE
* RATE

A metric's type is stored as metrics metadata and is used to determine how a metric is interpreted throughout the application by determining default time aggregation function and `as_rate()`/`as_count()` behavior. The `as_count()` and `as_rate()` modifiers behave differently for different Web Application metric types.

### Submission types and Datadog in-app types

Datadog accepts metrics submitted from a variety of sources, and as a result the "submission type" (think "use-case") does not always map exactly to the Datadog in-app type:

| Submission Source   | Submission Method (python)           | Submission Type   | Datadog In-App Type |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| [API][3]            | `api.Metric.send(type="count", ...)` | count             | count               |
| [API][3]            | `api.Metric.send(type="gauge", ...)` | gauge             | gauge               |
| [API][3]            | `api.Metric.send(type="rate", ...)`  | rate              | rate                |
| [DogStatsD][1]      | `dog.gauge(...)`                     | gauge             | gauge               |
| [DogStatsD][1]      | `dog.distribution(...)`              | distribution      | distribution        |
| [DogStatsD][1]      | `dog.histogram(...)`                 | histogram         | gauge, rate         |
| [DogStatsD][1]      | `dog.increment(...)`                 | counter           | rate                |
| [DogStatsD][1]      | `dog.set(...)`                       | set               | gauge               |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.count(...)`                    | count             | count               |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.gauge(...)`                    | gauge             | gauge               |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.histogram(...)`                | histogram         | gauge, rate         |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.increment(...)`                | counter <sup>deprecated</sup> | rate    |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.monotonic_count(...)`          | monotonic_count   | count               |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.rate(...)`                     | rate              | gauge               |
| [Agent check][2]    | `self.set(...)`                      | set               | gauge               |

### Modify a metric's type

While it is not normally required, it is possible to change a metric's _type_. Some examples:

1. You have a metric `app.requests.served` that counts requests served, but accidentally submitted it via StatsD as a `gauge`. The metric's Datadog type is therefore `gauge`.

2. You realize you should have submitted it as a StatsD `counter` metric, that way you can do time aggregation to answer questions like "How many total requests were served in the past day?" by querying `sum:app.requests.served{*}` (this would not make sense for a `gauge`-type  metric.)

3. You like the name `app.requests.served` so rather than submitting a new metric name with the more appropriate `counter` type, you could change the type of `app.requests.served`.
  * By updating your submission code, calling `dogstatsd.increment('app.requests.served', N)` after N requests are served.
  * By updating the Datadog in-app type via the metric summary page to `rate`.

This causes data submitted before the type change for `app.requests.served`to behave incorrectly because it was stored in a format to be interpreted as an in-app `gauge` not a `rate`. Data submitted after steps 3a and 3b
is interpreted properly.

If you are not willing to lose the historical data submitted as a `gauge`, create a new metric name with the new type, leaving the type of `app.requests.served` unchanged.

## Units

To eliminate ambiguity and help you make sense of your systems as quickly as possible, the following units may be associated with metrics submitted to Datadog.

| type         | unit(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Units are displayed automatically on timeseries graphs, query value widgets, and toplists, as shown in the screenshot of a Redis dashboard below:

{{< img src="developers/metrics/redis_dash_metrics_units.png" alt="Redis dash metric units" responsive="true" style="width:70%;">}}

On timeseries graphs, move your cursor over any graph to see the relevant units. The raw data is automatically converted to readable display units (fractions of a second to ms, millions of bytes per second to MiB/s, etc.):

{{< img src="developers/metrics/postgres_commits.png" alt="postgres commits" responsive="true" style="width:70%;">}}

Units are also displayed at the bottom of Timeboard graphs, and metric descriptions are available by selecting *Metrics Info* from the gear dropdown:

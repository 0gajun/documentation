<%= http_body <<eos
{
  "title": (String) event heading in the event stream
  "text": (String) event body in the event stream

  "date_happened": POSIX timestamp (default, now)
  "priority": (String) "normal", "low" (default, normal)
  "related_event_id": (String) id of the related (aggregate) event
		      (default, none)
  "tags": [String] a list of tags (default, none)
  "alert_type": (String) "error", "warning", "info", "success"
                (default, info)
  "source_type_name": (String) type of event (default, none)

"source_type_name" can be any of the following keywords:

`nagios`, `hudson`, `jenkins`, `user`, `my apps`, `feed`, `chef`, `puppet`, `git`, `bitbucket`, `fabric`, `capistrano`

### Response

<%= response_headers 201, 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' %>
<%= http_body <<eos
{
  "id": (Integer) uid
  "title": (String) event heading in the event stream
  "text": (String) event body in the event stream
  "date_happened": POSIX timestamp
  "handle": (String) user name
  "priority": (String) "normal", "low"
  "related_event_id": (String) id of the related event
  "tags": [String] a list of tags
}
eos
%>

### Aggregation

When posting related events you can tell Datadog to group them
by passing an aggregation key. Host names, process IDs,
customer IDs are often used as aggregation keys. Once aggregated,
events will be grouped under the same heading in the stream.

While there is no hard limit to the number of events aggregated with
the same key, you may find that grouping more than a few hundred
events makes the stream harder to navigate.

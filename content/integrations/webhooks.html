<h3>Overview</h3>

With Webhooks you'll be able to:
<ul>
<li> Connect to your services.</li>
<li> Alert your services when a metric alert is triggered.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p>To create a webhook, just enter the URL and a name. Then to use your 
webhook in Datadog, just add @webhook-name_of_the_webhook in the 
text of the metric alert you want to trigger the webhook. It will 
trigger a POST request to the URL you set with the following content in JSON format.</p>

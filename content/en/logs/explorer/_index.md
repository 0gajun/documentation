## Overview

The Logs Explorer is your home base for troubleshooting and exploration:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_explorer_walkthrough.gif" alt="Explore view with comments"  >}}

Different views offer different type of insights from your log data matching a [search query][1].

### Live Tail

The Live Tail displays logs as they flow into Datadog. Livetail has no persistance but provides visibility on **all** logs, whether they are indexed or not. Find out more in the [Log Live Tail section][17].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_explorer_walkthrough_livetail.gif" alt="Log Livetail"  >}}


### Log Lists

The Log List displays indexed logs and offer priviledged tools to navigate in **individual results**. Find out more in the [Log List section][16].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_explorer_walkthrough_list.png" alt="Log List"  >}}

### Log Patterns

The Log Patterns automatically aggregates indexed logs into a **handful of groups** with similar structure. Find out more in the [Log Patterns section][3].

### Log Analytics

The Log Analytics **graph** log queries and see maximums, averages, percentiles, unique counts, and more. Follow the [log graphing guide][5] to learn more about all the graphing options.

## The Log Side Panel

Datadog displays individual logs following this general side-panel layout:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_side_panel.png" alt="Log Side Panel"  style="width:60%;">}}

### Log Structured Information

* The upper part of the panel displays general **context** information.
* The lower part of the panel displays the actual **content** of the log.

**Context** is all about the Infrastructure and Applicative context in which the log has been generated. Information is gathered from tags, whether automatically attached (host name, container name, log file name, serverless function name, etc. ) or added through custom tags (team in charge, environment, application version, etc.) on the log by the Datadog Agent / Log Forwarder. 

**Content** is the log per se: the log message, and all structured information extracted and enriched from the logs through [Log Pipelines][9]. For logs generated by common components of a technical stack, parsing and enriching comes out-of-the-box: 

* For file log collection, make sure you properly setup the source field, which triggers that. See our [100+ Log Integrations][8] for reference.
* For container log collection, take advantage of the [auto-discovery][10].

Some standard  fields — for instance, `error.stack`, `http.method`, or `duration` — have specific prettified displays in the Log Panel for better readability. Make sure you extract corresponding information from your logs and remap your attributes with [standard attribute remappers][6].


### A hub to other data sources 

Interact with the upper reserved attributes section:

- with **Host** section, to access the related [host dashboard][11] or [network page][12].
- with **Service** section, to see the [trace in APM][14] (both require a `trace_id` attribute in the log: refer to [trace injection in logs][7]) or the [service page][13].

The **View in context** button updates the search request in order to show you the log lines dated just before and after a selected log—even if they don't match your filter. This context is different according to the situation, as Datadog uses the `Hostname`, `Service`, `filename`, and `container_id` attributes, along with tags, in order find the appropriate context for your logs.

### Configure your troubleshooting context

Interact with the attributes names and values in the lower JSON section to:

- Add or remove a column from the logs table.
- Append the search request with specific values (include or exclude)

{{< img src="logs/explorer/side_panel_context.png" alt="Side Panel Hub"  style="width:60%;">}}

- Build or edit a facet or measure from an attribute - see [Log Facets][15].

{{< img src="logs/explorer/side_panel_facets.gif" alt="Side Panel Facets"  style="width:60%;">}}


### Share a log

Use the **Share** button to share the log opened in side panel to other contexts.

- **Copy to clipboard** or `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` copies the log JSON to your clipboard.
- **Share Event** shares the log (along with the underlying view) with teammates through email, Slack, and more. See all [Datadog notification integrations][4] available.

## Troubleshooting Context

### Search Filter 

Build up a context to explore your logs in your log explorer view first by selecting the proper time range then by using the search bar to filter your Logstream and Log Analytics.

**Time Range**

The time range feature allows you to display logs in the Logstream or Log Analytics within a given time period.
It appears directly under the search bar as a timeline. The timeline can be displayed or wrapped up with the **Show timeline** check box in the Logstream option panel.

Quickly change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/timerange.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Timerange"  >}}

**Search**

Use facets, measures, tags, or even [free text search][1] to filter your Logstream and Log Analytics with dedicated context. The search bar and url automatically reflect your selections.

Follow the [guide to search your logs][1] for a detailed explanation of all the Log Explorer search features, including use of wildcards and queries of numerical values.

### Saved views

Use saved views to automatically configure your log explorer with a preselected set of facets, measures, searches, time ranges, and visualizations. Check the dedicated [saved views documentation][2] to learn more.


### Share views

Export your current log visualization with the _share_ functionality:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/send_view_to.png" alt="Send view to"  style="width:60%;">}}

Use the _share_ button to send your current log explorer view to a CSV file or team member, or create a monitor:

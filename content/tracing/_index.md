## Overview

Datadog's integrated APM tool eliminates the traditional separation between infrastructure and application performance monitoring. This not only provides greater visibility, but also allows you to see the relationship between application code and the underlying infrastructure.

Datadog APM is offered as an upgrade to our Pro and Enterprise plans. A free 14-day trial is available.
Registered users can visit the [APM page of the Datadog application](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/home) to get started.

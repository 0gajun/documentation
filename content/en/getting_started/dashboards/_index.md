## Overview

Before you even started using Datadog, you probably read about, heard talk of, or saw demos of Datadog dashboards. That's because for all the powerful metrics data and all the monitor alerts, what matters most is the conversations you have with your coworkers, your bosses, your service providers, or your customers about what those things mean and what actions to take as a result of knowing about them. Well-made dashboards can launch those conversations.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already, create a [Datadog account][1]. Install an agent on a host, and an integration for something running on that host.

## Get started using dashboards
A key to getting started setting up effective dashboards is knowing what kinds of conversations you want to have. What questions do you ask yourself regularly? What does your management chain ask you about? What do your customers complain about that you want early knowledge of? When a problem happens, what series of questions helps you dive down and find the solution? 

Creating a good dashboard is about bringing the answers to these questions to the surface. If youâ€™ve been tasked with creating a dashboard about a certain aspect of your infrastructure, start with finding out what questions people have about it.

This guide will talk about three key types of dashboards that many Datadog users create: team dashboards, executive dashboards, and troubleshooting dashboards. These aren't formal types of dashboards; there's no "Create an Executive Dashboard" button anywhere in the Datadog app. But these three types reflect major use cases for dashboards, and each suggests a different approach to creating the dashboards themselves.

- [Create an executive dashboard][3]
- [Create a troubleshooting dashboard][4]

This guide gets you started on a path to making dashboards that can guide real conversations, not just fill screen space. These basic dashboards will help your team talk about things that really matter to you, show your managers the value you (and Datadog) bring to your organization, and get to the bottom of problems quickly.

After you've had some success creating basic dashboards, you can explore mixing and matching the approaches to meet your needs.

title: Getting Started with Metrics
---

This tutorial will walk you through instrumenting your application to send
custom metrics to Datadog. If you need some help as you go, pop by our
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/datadog">IRC channel</a>.

## DogStatsd

DogStatsd is a metrics aggregation server that implements the Statsd
protocol, but with a few extensions for Datadog special sauce. It is bundled
with the Datadog agent (from version FIXME and up), so once that's running
you're ready to start collecting custom metrics in whatever language you
use.

The Statsd protocol uses UDP, which is a good fit for instrumentation because
your application won't block waiting for a response from the server.

## Configuration

By default, DogStatsd runs o

## Installation

- Set up the datadog agent
- Configure your client.

## Metrics

### Gauges

Gauges measure the value of a particular thing at a
particular time, like the amount of fuel in a car's gas tank or
the number of users connected to a system.

    # In Python ...
    dog.gauge('gas_tank.level', 0.75)
    dog.gauge('users.active', 1001)

### Counters

Counters track how many times something happened happened, like the number of
database requests or page views.

    dog.increment('database.query.count')
    dog.increment('page_view.count')

### Histograms

Histograms track the statistical distribution of a set of values, like the
duration of database queries or the size of files uploaded by users. Each
histogram will track the average, minimum, maximum and the 75th, 85th, 95th and
99th percentiles.

    dog.histogram('database.query.time', 0.5)
    dog.histogram('file.upload.size', file.get_size())

## Sample Rates

The overhead of sending UDP packets can be too great for some performance
instensive code paths. If this is the case, Statsd clients support sampling,
that is to say, only sending metrics a percentage of the time. For example:

    dog.histogram('my.histogram', 1, rate=0.5)

will only be sent to the server about half of the time.

## Tags

DogStatsd extends the Statsd protocol to support tags. Adding a tag is a metric
is like adding a dimension to let you

that lets you slice and dice metrics from different circumstances. For example
if you want to A/B test performance fixes on a hot code path, you could tag the
duration of each path with the version of the code. For example:

    start_time = time()
    if random() > 0.5:
        version = 'old'
        do_old_thing()
    else:
        version = 'new'
        do_new_thing()
    duration = time() - start_time
    dog.histogram('thing.duration', duration, tags='version:' + version)

## See monthly usage reports for each of my sub-organizations

As an administrator, you have access to all usage details for each sub-organization as described [in the usage a details common questions](https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004097483-Usage-Details-Common-Questions). The usage details includes hourly usage across all billable parameters as well as the top 500 custom metrics for each sub-organization. Further detailed usage reports can also be created on request by your account representative.

It is worth noting that each sub-organization you create is rolled up to a parent account. This relationship  applies solely to billing, however metrics and events continue to be isolate in their own individual organizations.

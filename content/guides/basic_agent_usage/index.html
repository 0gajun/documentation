The Datadog agent is piece of software that runs on your hosts. Its job is to faithfully collect events and metrics and bring them to Datadog on
your behalf so that you can do something useful with your monitoring and performance data.

The source code for the agent can be found <a href='https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent'>here</a>.

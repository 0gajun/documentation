DogStatsD can emit events to your [Datadog event stream][1]. For example, you may want to see errors and exceptions in Datadog:

```python

from datadog import statsd

def render_page():
  try:
    # Render the page...
    # ..
  except RenderError as err:
    statsd.event('Page render error!', err.message, alert_type='error')
```

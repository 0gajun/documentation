## Getting started with the Agent

Collecting logs is enabled by default in the Datadog-Agent.
[Install the latest Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) and that will collect logs for you.

## Overview 

Log analysis can be decomposed into 4 steps:

1. [Collection](/log/collection)
2. [Pipeline](/log/pipeline)
3. [Parsing](/log/parsing)
4. [Explore](/log/explore)

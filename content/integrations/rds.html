In this HOWTO you will learn how to best integrate AWS Relational
Database Service (RDS) with Datadog.

<h2>How this works</h2>

RDS provides database instances and reports
instance metrics via Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch metrics are collected at
most one per minute and do not provide a comprehensive coverage of RDS
performance.

To get real-time metrics from your MySQL or PostgreSQL instances you
will need to use a Datadog agent that connects to your RDS instances.
Because the agent metrics will be tied to the instance where the agent
is running and not to the actual RDS instance, you will use tags to
connect all metrics together.

Once the agent is configured with the same tags as the RDS instance,
getting MySQL/PostgreSQL metrics in context of RDS metrics is child's
play.

<h2>Step-by-step</h2>

<h3>1. Find your RDS instance tags</h3>

<h3>2. Configure an agent and connect to your RDS instance</h3>

<h3>3. Visualize RDS and MySQL/PostgreSQL metrics together</h3>

You can easily update your credit card info in the Datadog app by navigating to the [Plan page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing) and clicking the "Update Credit Card" button.

You can find the Plan and Usage page by mousing over your name in the lower left of the app.

Note: You must be a Datadog Administrator to see the Plan page. If you cannot see that page, please contact an Administrator in your company who can make that change for you or grant you the appropriate permissions.

If you have any questions, please reach out your [Customer Success Manager](mailto:success@datadoghq.com) or [billing](mailto:billing@datadoghq.com).

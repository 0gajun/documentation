The Distribution visualization is another way of showing metrics aggregated across one or several tags, such as *hosts*. Unlike the [heat map][1], distribution's x-axis is the quantity rather than time.

This visualization displays only a single metric query; additional queries are disregarded.

**Note**: Outlier detection cannot be performed for this visualization.

## Setup

{{< img src="graphing/widgets/distribution/distribution_setup.png" alt="Distribution" responsive="true" style="width:80%;">}}

### Configuration

Configure your metric query as usual. Note that this visualization type is useful only when metrics are aggregated across Tag Keys , e.g. for each `host`. 
Make a selection in the "`avg`/`max`/`min`/`sum by`â€¦" control to see your data across the associated tags.

### Options
#### Display preference

##### Global time

On Screenboard only, choose whether your widget has a custom timeframe or the global timeframe of the Screenboard.

##### Legend

Enable legend display on your widget by selecting the *Show legend on graph* toggle. Optionally, select the amount of entries to display.

#### Title

Display a custom title for your widget by activating the `Show a Title` check box:

**Note**: it is not recommended to use the agent for log collection only. 
Using metric collection ensure that your logs, metrics and traces from the same host share the same hostname and therefore the same tags.

However if there is no official flag to disable metric collection for the agent, it is still possible to configure it to only collect logs.

The Agent send metrics to a specific url that is specified in the `datadog.yaml` file.

1. Open `datadog.yaml` (see this [page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/basic_agent_usage/#configuration-file) to locate this configuration file on your instance)
2. Edit the `dd_url` attribute to any custom value

For example:

```yaml
dd_url: https://datadog-nometric.com/
```

3. Configure the agent to collect logs as explained here: https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/
4. Restart the agent

is designed to make it easy to report custom metrics from existing Python
applications and build new tools on top of the API.

The Python `dogapi` also provides a command line `dog` command that can be used
to explore and interact with the Datadog API right from the terminal. The `dog`
command is also ideal for scripting. It can provide data in a line-oriented
format perfect for grepping and awking to your heart's content, and it works
with shell redirection allowing you to easily send `/dev/random` directly to
your event stream!

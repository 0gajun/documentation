From the Security Signals Explorer, you can triage security signals.

{{< img src="security_monitoring/explorer/security_signals_explorer_view.png" alt="Security Signals Explorer view" responsive="true" >}}


In this view, you can:

* [Build a context](#context) to explore your Security Signals.
* [Visualize your Security Signals](#visualization) as a filtered Security Signals table or Security Signals Analytics.
* [Share the content](#share-views) of your Security Signal Explorer view to another page within or outside of Datadog.

## Context

Build up a context to explore your signals in your Security Signals Explorer view. First, select the proper time range. Then, use the [search](#search) bar to filter your signals.

### Time range

The time range feature allows you to display signals in the Security Signals Search or Security Signal Analytics views within a given time period. It appears directly under the search bar as a timeline. 

Quickly change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown:

### Search

Use facets on entities, tags, or even [free text search][1] to filter your Security Signals Search or Security Signal Analytics with dedicated context. The search bar and url automatically reflect your selections.

### Share views

Export your current security signal visualization with the *share* functionality:

{{< img src="security_monitoring/explorer/share_security_signals_view.png" alt="Share Security Signals view" responsive="true" style="width:60%;">}}


Use the *share* button to send your current Security Signal explorer view to a team member.


## Visualization

Switch between the Security Signals Table and the Security Signals Analytics modes by clicking on the *Signal Mode* button in the upper left corner of the page:

The Security Signals Table displays the list of signals that match the selected context. A context is defined by a [search bar](#search) filter and a [time range](#time-range).


### Security Signals Table

The Security Signals search results are displayed in the Security Signals Table.

Configure the content of your Security Signals Table according to your needs and preferences with the **Options** button. Only faceted attributes are available for columns.

Security Signal results are sorted by dateâ€”the most recent on top by default. You can also inverse-sort by date, with the least recent (within the limits of the time range) on top.

### Security Signal Panel

Click on any Security Signal to open the Security Signal Panel and see more details about it: signal creation date, first seen date, last seen date, classification, tags, security signal message, and the samples that triggered the Security Signal.
 
Use the **Share** button to share the Security Signal opened in side panel to a team member or any other Datadog notification integration.

### Security Signals Analytics

After Security Signals are generated by the Security Rules Engine, you can graph Security Signal queries and see maximums, minimums, percentiles, unique counts, and more. 

Follow the [log graphing guide][2] to learn more about all the graphing options.

Troubleshooting and Questions
</h3>

Do you have redis-py library, version 2.0.0? You might need to 
<a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/374">upgrade</a> 
if you are having difficulties!

Q: With Redis, even after install python-redis we get this error:

>

	echo -e "\e[0;31mMissing redis python module - Failure\e[0m" || \
	> echo -e "\e[0;32mredis python module - OK\e[0m"
	*Missing redis python module - Failure*


A: For CentOS5 we will look for python2.6, use that if it’s available, otherwise 
we will default to the system python (2.4, in this case). The easiest solution 
would be to remove Python 2.6 altogether and restart the Agent which should 
have it default to 2.4 and the redis checks should then work as expected.

Q: Can the redis plugin draw metrics from different ports on the same host, 
if we are running more than 1 redis instance on each server?
<br>A: Yes! The value for `redis_urls` in your datadog.conf file can be a list of 
comma-separated redis hosts, such as:

```
	redis_urls: localhost:6379, localhost:6380
```

Q: How do I filter to look at 
the stats for a particular DB in a particular environment?
<br>A: Prebuilt dashboards only allow you to filter on a single tag (these are the 
dashboards you see when clicking ‘overview’). If you go to the Metrics Explorer (‘Metrics’ tab → ‘Explorer’), 
you can select which metrics you want to see and what you want to see it over. 
In the ‘Over:’ section you can select multiple 
environments and then select “Save these tiles to: a new dashboard.”

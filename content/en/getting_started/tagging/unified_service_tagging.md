## Overview
Unified service tagging ties Datadog telemetry together through the use of three [reserved tags][1]: `env`, `service`, and `version`. These tags allow you to correlate related logs and traces by version of a service, trace a spike in CPU usage to corresponding areas of a service, and organize infrastructure more effectively.

The [environment variables][2] `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` form a single point of configuration for all telemetry emitted directly from your service's runtime: [traces][3], [logs][4], and [StatsD metrics][5]. These variables are specific to the runtime of your service. They allow you to define core tagging configuration within your application, rather than across your application and the Agent.

When spans are configured with `DD_VERSION`, the tracer will add version to all spans that fall under the service that "owns" the tracer (generally DD_SERVICE). This means that if your service creates spans with the name of an external service, those spans will not receive version as a tag. As long as version is present in spans, it will be added to trace metrics generated from those spans. The version can be added manually in-code or automatically by the tracer.

When available, version is added to logs like any other tag.

At the very least they will be used by the APM and [Dogstatsd clients][6] to tag trace data and statsd metrics with `env`, `service`, and `version`. If enabled, the APM tracer will also inject the values of these variables into your logs.

Depending on your CI/CD pipeline and how you run your service (e.g., as a binary or through a Docker container), you may wish to set these environment variables depending on whether your environment is [containerized](#containerized-environment) or [non-containerized](#non-containerized-environment).

## Requirements

- Unified service tagging requires knowledge of tagging and assigning tags. If you are unsure of how to configure tags, read the [Getting Started with Tagging][7] guide and [Assigning tags][8] documentation before proceeding to configuration.

- Unified service tagging requires setup of the [Datadog Agent][9].

- This guide requires [Autodiscovery][10] for unified service tagging in a containerized environment.

## Recommendations

If you're using [connected Logs and Traces][11], it is recommended to enable automatic logs injection. The APM tracer will then automatically add these fields to your logs, thereby eliminating manual configuration for those fields elsewhere.

## Configuration

### Containerized environment

#### Autodiscovery

In containerized environments, [Autodiscovery][10] tags `env`, `service`, and `version` from standard labels and environment variables. Since the Agent associates data collected with specific containers, the configuration for the standard tags can conveniently reside within the container's metadata.

Additionally, the Autodiscovered tags for `env`, `service`, and `version` are added to all data generated by integration or logs checks. You will not need to add these tags to each check's configuration.

#### Set the variables

While service is generally "constant", `env` and `version` might be determined at build time or afterwards. If known at build time, these parameters could be "baked" into a container's image. Since the environment variables would become part of the image, they'd be available when the container is started. Consider this as an option if injecting the environment variables later on is not possible.

Conversely, it might be more convenient to inject the `DD_*` environment variables at deploy time. If so, you can leverage the relevant API for your containerized infrastructure.

**Note**: It's recommend to set **all three environment variables at the same time and place** if possible. This helps to control consistency across configuration files for all of your applications.

##### Pod-level metrics
Add the following standard labels (`tags.datadoghq.com`) to the pod spec of a Deployment, StatefulSet, or Job.

```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tags.datadoghq.com/env: <ENV>
        tags.datadoghq.com/service: <SERVICE>
        tags.datadoghq.com/version: <VERSION>
```
These labels cover pod-level Kubernetes CPU, memory, network, and disk metrics, and are used for injecting `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` into your service's container.

If you have multiple containers per pod, you can specify standard labels by container:

```yaml
tags.datadoghq.com/<container-name>.env
tags.datadoghq.com/<container-name>.service
tags.datadoghq.com/<container-name>.version
```

##### State metrics

For [Kubernetes State Metrics][1], add the same standard labels to the collection of labels for the parent resource (e.g., Deployment).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    tags.datadoghq.com/env: <ENV>
    tags.datadoghq.com/service: <SERVICE>
    tags.datadoghq.com/version: <VERSION>
spec:
  <Block from above>
```

##### APM Tracer / StatsD client

[APM Tracer][2] and [StatsD client][3] environment variables can be sourced from the same labels by using the [Kubernetes's downward API][4] in the format below:

```yaml
    containers:
    -  ...
       env:
            - name: DD_ENV
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/env']
            - name: DD_SERVICE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/service']
            - name: DD_VERSION
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/version']
```

{{% tab "Docker" %}}
To achieve a single point of configuration across all telemetry, make `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` available within your container's runtime environment. As long as the Agent can access your container's [Docker socket][1], it will be able to detect the environment variables and map them to the standard tags.

If your service has no need for the Datadog environment variables (for example, third party software like Redis, PostgreSQL, NGINX, and applications not traced by APM), you can instead use Docker labels:

```yaml
  LABEL com.datadoghq.tags.env="<ENV>"
  LABEL com.datadoghq.tags.service="<SERVICE>"
  LABEL com.datadoghq.tags.version="<VERSION>"
```

{{% tab "ECS" %}}

To achieve a single point of configuration across all telemetry, make `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` available within your container's runtime environment. These variables can be set in the Docker image itself or in the ECS task's definition:

```yaml
        "environment": [
          {
            "name": "DD_ENV",
            "value": "<ENV>"
          },
          {
            "name": "DD_SERVICE",
            "value": "<SERVICE>"
          },
          {
            "name": "DD_VERSION",
            "value": "<VERSION>"
          }
        ]
```

If there are containers that will not benefit from using the environment variables in the application runtime, you can instead use Docker labels:

```yaml
        "dockerLabels": {
          "com.datadoghq.tags.env": "<ENV>",
          "com.datadoghq.tags.service": "<SERVICE>",
          "com.datadoghq.tags.version": "<VERSION>"
        }
```

### Non-containerized environment

#### Set the variables
Depending on how you build and deploy your services' binaries or executables, you may have several options available for setting `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION`. Since you may run one or more services per host, we recommend that these environment variables be scoped to a single process.

You may elect export the environment variables in the command for your executable:

`DD_ENV=<env> DD_SERVICE=<service> DD_VERSION=<version> /bin/my-service`

Or you might use [Chef][12], [Ansible][13], or another orchestration tool to populate a service's systemd or initd configuration file with the `DD` environment variables. That way when the service process is started it will have access to those variables.

#### Configure traces, logs, StatsD metrics

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Traces" %}}

As a best practice, it is recommended to configure your [APM tracer][1] with `DD_ENV` as it keeps the definition of env closer to the application that is generating the traces. This method allows the `env` tag to be sourced automatically from a tag in the span metadata.

**Note: There can only be one service per span.** Trace metrics generally have a single service as well. However, if you have a different service defined in your hosts' tags, that configured service tag will show up on all trace metrics emitted from that host.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Logs" %}}

If you already have [traces enabled for logs injection][1], it will also inject `env`, `service`, and `version` into your logs.

If you already have logs configuration checks defined similarly to the example below, you **do not** need to define `service`:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: "/path/to/your/log.log"
    source: python
    log_processing_rules:
      ...
    tags:
      ...
```

This configuration will allow existing configurations, such as log processing rules or other tags, to continue to work exactly the same.

If you do not wish to use automatic log injection from the APM tracer, you also have the option of [manually injecting these fields into logs][2].

[2]: /tracing/connect_logs_and_traces/java?tab=log4j2#manual-trace-id-injection
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "StatsD" %}}

Tags are added in an append-only fashion for [custom statsd metrics][1]. For example, if you have two different values for env, the metrics will be tagged with both envs. There is no order in which one tag will override another of the same name.

## Introduction

Tags are a way of adding dimensions to metrics, so they can be sliced, diced, aggregated, and compared on the front end. [Using tags][1] enables you to observe aggregate performance across a number of hosts and (optionally) narrow the set further based on specific elements. In a nutshell, tagging is a method to scope aggregated data.

## Why It Matters

Typically, it's helpful to look at containers, VMs and cloud infrastructure at the "service" level in aggregate. For example, it's more helpful to look at CPU across a collection of hosts that represents a service, rather than CPU for server A or server B separately.

Containers and cloud environments regularly churn through hosts, so it is critical to tag these to allow for aggregation of the metrics you're getting.

## How To Use

A few best practices on tags:

1. Tags must **start with a letter**, and after that may contain:

    * Alphanumerics
    * Underscores
    * Minuses
    * Colons
    * Periods
    * Slashes

    Other special characters get converted to underscores.
    **Note**: A tag cannot end with a colon (e.g., `tag:`)
2. Tags can be **up to 200 characters** long and support unicode.
3. Tags are converted to lowercase.
4. A tag can have a `value` or a `key:value` syntax:
    **For optimal functionality, we recommend constructing tags that use the `key:value` syntax.** The key is always what precedes the first colon of the global tag definition, e.g.:

    * `role:database:mysql` is parsed as **key**:`role` , **value**:`database:mysql`
    * `role_database:mysql` is parsed as **key**:`role_database` , **value**:`mysql`

    Examples of commonly used metric tag keys are `env`, `instance`, `name`, and `role`.

5. `device`, `host`, and `source` are **reserved tag keys** and cannot be specified in the standard way.

6. Tags shouldn't originate from unbounded sources, such as EPOCH timestamps or user IDs. These tags may impact platform performance and billing.

## Assigning Tags

Tags may be assigned using any (or all) of the following methods:

* Agent Tags (`datadog.yaml`)
* [DogStatsD][2] Tags
* Integration/Check Tags (each check on the local host supports tags by editing the yaml)
* Tags generated by other services such as [AWS][3], [Azure][4], [GCE][5], etc.
* Tags in the [API][6] - note other endpoints support tags as well such as Events and Metrics
* [Chef Roles][7] and [Puppet][8] Tags (Chef and Puppet use the API - this may obviously be extended to other configuration management tools by you or Datadog)
* Manually adding tags using the [Infrastructure List][9] (hover over host->select "Inspect"->"Edit Tags")

## Using Tags

After you have assigned tags at the host and [integration][11] level, you can start using them to filter and group in interesting ways. There are several places you can use tags. Explore the various areas in the UI:

* [Events][12]
* [Dashboards][13]
* [Infrastructure][14]
* [Monitors][15]
* [Metrics][16]
* [APM][17]
* [Notebooks][18]
* [Logs][19]

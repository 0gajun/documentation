Credit Card paying customers can access past invoices [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing_history) in "Billing History" (click on your avatar->Plan & Usage->Billing History->Invoice) - note this is only available for [Admin accounts](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/team).
 
Customers who pay via wire/check have invoices emailed to them when due. If you need a copy, please email [billing](mailto:billing@datadoghq.com).

After you have [installed the Datadog Agent][1], [enabled trace collection][2], [configured your environment](#configure-your-environment), and then instrument your application using one of the libraries locally, or in a container.

## Configure your environment

There are several ways to specify an environment when reporting data:
1. Host tag: Use a host tag with the format env:<ENVIRONMENT> to tag all traces from that Agent accordingly.
2. Agent configuration: Override the default tag used by the Agent in the Agent configuration file. This tags all traces coming through the Agent, overriding the host tag value.
  apm_config:
  env: <ENVIRONMENT>
4. Per trace: When submitting a single trace, specify an environment by tagging one of its spans with the metadata key env. This overrides the Agent configuration and the host tagâ€™s value (if any). Consult the trace tagging documentationto learn how to assign a tag to your traces.

## Local setup

APM is enabled by default in Agent 6. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` if you are sending traces from a nonlocal env(containers). To get an overview of all the possible settings for APM, take a look at the Agent's [datadog.example.yaml][3] configuration file. For more information about the Datadog Agent, see the [dedicated doc page][4] or refer to the [datadog.yaml templates][5].

### Language setup

To instrument an application written in a language that does not yet have official library support, visit the list of [community tracing libraries][6].

## Containerized setup

Once your application is instrumented with the tracing client, by default traces will be sent to `localhost:8126`. Please see the below setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

**Note**: If you're using Kubernetes, make sure to [enable APM in your Daemonset setup][7]. If you're using Docker, [enable the Trace Agent in your application][8].

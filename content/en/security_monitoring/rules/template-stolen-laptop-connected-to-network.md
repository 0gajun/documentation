## Overview

### **Goal:**
Detect when a stolen laptop has been connected to the network.

### **Strategy:**
Using the Datadog [Lookup Processor][1] you can maintain a blacklist of MAC addresses.
When a MAC address connects to the network, the @threat.stolen_laptop attribute will be set to `true`.
This threat detection rule queries for `@threat.stolen_laptop:true` and generates a security signal. 

### **Triage & Response:**
You should use this section to enter your triage and response process for when a stolen laptop has connected to your network.
This section helps users responding to the security signal quickly triage and respond to the signal.

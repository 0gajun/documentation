<h3>Overview</h3>

Capture Nagios activity in Datadog to:
<ul>
<li> Identify trends in service failures at a glance.</li>
<li> Recall issue resolutions with a single click.</li>
<li> Discuss service failures with your team.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Set up information collection for Nagios in the file

After having Nagios reporting to Datadog for a week, an interactive report on alerting checks can be found

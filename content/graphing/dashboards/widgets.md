## Timeseries

The Timeseries visualization is great for showing one or more metrics over time. The time window depends on what is selected on the timeboard or in the graph on a screenboard. Timeseries' can be displayed as lines, areas, and bars. Timeseries is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

## Query Value

## Heatmap

The Heatmap visualization is great for showing metrics aggregated across many tags, such as *hosts*. The more hosts that have a particular value, the darker that square will be.  Heatmap is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

## Distribution

The Distribution visualization is another way of showing metrics aggregated across many tags, such as *hosts*. Unlike the Heatmap, Distribution's x-axis is the quantity rather than time. Distribution is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

## Toplist

The Toplist visualization is perfect when you want to see the list of hosts with the most or least of any metric value, such as highest consumers of CPU, hosts with the least disk space, etc. Toplist is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

## Hostmap

The Hostmap will graph any metric for any subset of hosts on the same hostmap visualization available from the main Infrastructure Hostmap menu.

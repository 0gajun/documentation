<h3>Overview</h3>

Connect NGINX to Datadog in order to:
<ul>
<li> Visualize your web server performance</li>
<li> Correlate the performance of Nginx with the rest of your applications</li>
</ul>
</div>

From the open-source Agent:

* <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/conf.d/nginx.yaml.example">NGINX YAML Example</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/checks.d/nginx.py">NGINX checks.d</a>

The following metrics are collected by default with the NGINX integration:

    nginx.net.connections
    nginx.net.reading
    nginx.net.request_per_s
    nginx.net.waiting
    nginx.net.writing

If you are using NGINX Plus, you can collect many more metrics, as described on the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#data">NGINX docs</a>. For a list of the NGINX Plus metric names as you'd see them in Datadog, see <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/tests/data/nginx_plus_out.python">this file</a>.

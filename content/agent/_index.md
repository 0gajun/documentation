## What is the Agent?

The Datadog Agent is a piece of software that runs on your hosts. Its job is to faithfully collect events and metrics and bring them to Datadog on
your behalf so that you can do something useful with your monitoring and performance data. The Datadog Agent is open-sourced. You may view the source code on GitHub for [Agent v5](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent) and [Agent v6](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent). To see all changes between Agent v5 and v6, [consult our dedicated changes documentation](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/docs/agent/changes.md).

## Agent Troubleshooting

If you ended up at this page and have not yet installed the Datadog Agent, go [to the dedicated agent integration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) for installation instructions. If you just installed the Agent, it might take a few moments before you start seeing metrics appear. The first place you should check for metrics is the [Metrics Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/explorer).

If you think you might be experiencing issues, the first thing to do is [run the info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) and check the [Agent logs](/agent/#log-locations).

If you're still unsure about the issue, you may reach out to [Datadog support team](/help) along with [a flare](/agent/faq/send-logs-and-configs-to-datadog-via-flare-command) of your agent.

The performance overview dashboard offers a birdâ€™s-eye view of RUM applications. It is separated in 3 sections:

- **Performance metrics**:
    For all views(link), we highlight 3 browser metrics from the ones we collect automatically: First Contentful Paint, DOM Content Loaded and Load Event. For each of these metrics, widgets show the median, the 75th percentile and the 90th percentile.
- **Trends**:
    Visualize the evolution of page views, front-end errors related to back-end calls failing, JS errors and long tasks.
- **Page views breakdown**:
    Analyze the nature of your traffic and the associated load time for each segment.

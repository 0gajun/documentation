To use APM, start by enabling trace collection in Datadog. You can do this in multiple different ways depending on your system setup: including using the [Datadog Agent locally](#Datadog-Agent), [on containers](#Containers), and [several other ways](#Other-ways-to collect-traces). For the full overview of all of the steps to set up APM, see the [APM overivew][1].

## Datadog Agent

APM is enabled by default in Agent 6. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` if you are sending traces from a nonlocal environment (like a container). To get an overview of all the possible settings for APM, take a look at the Agent's [`datadog.example.yaml`][2] configuration file. For more information about the Datadog Agent, see the [dedicated doc page][3] or refer to the [`datadog.yaml` templates][4].

## Containers

See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

{{< partial name="apm/apm-containers.html" >}}

Once your application is instrumented with the tracing client, by default traces will be sent to `localhost:8126`. 

## Configure your environment

There are several ways to specify [an environment][5] when reporting data:

1. Host tag: Use a host tag with the format env:<ENVIRONMENT> to tag all traces from that Agent accordingly.
2. Agent configuration: Override the default tag used by the Agent in the Agent configuration file. This tags all traces coming through the Agent, overriding the host tag value.
  apm_config:
  env: <ENVIRONMENT>
4. Per trace: When submitting a single trace, specify an environment by tagging one of its spans with the metadata key env. This overrides the Agent configuration and the host tagâ€™s value (if any). Consult the trace tagging documentationto learn how to assign a tag to your traces.

## Other ways to collect traces

There are alternernates to the Agent and containers that you can use to collect traces.

### Lamda - X-Ray

For more information abut setting up Lamda - X-Ray, see the [Amazon X-Ray integration documentation][6]

### Heroku

Tracing is enabled by default when monitoring with Heroku. For more information abut configuring tracing for Heroku, see the [Heroku cloud documentation][7].

### Cloud Foundry

Tracing is enabled by default when monitoring with Cloud Foundry. For more information abut configuring tracing for Cloud Foundry, see the [Cloud Foundry documentation][8].

### Other(GAE, AAS, Serverless)

Datadog APM currently requires sending trace data to a running Agent. A workaround for enabling trace collection for a serverless setup is to setup a separate VM that accepts trace traffic externally.

## Next steps

For the full overview of all of the steps to set up APM, see the [APM overivew][1].

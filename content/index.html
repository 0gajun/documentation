## Collecting Custom Metrics

This section will walk you through the process of instrumenting your
application to send custom metrics to Datadog. Custom metrics will let you
correlate the happenings of your application with the performance of your
system.

If we take a look at the graph below, we can that our web request throughput is
dropping while the load on our database is increasing. Maybe the database is
a bottleneck and needs investigation.

There are a few ways to get started with sending metrics to DataDog.

#### [DogStatsd](guides/dogstatsd/)

DogStatsd is a metric aggregation server
bundled with the Datadog Agent. With you a few lines of code you'll have
custom metrics ready to be graphed on Datadog.

#### [Log Parsing](guides/logs/)

The Datadog Agent can parse application metrics
from log files. This is a great tool to instrument legacy and
vendor applications.


#### [API](/api)

Finally, if you have another source of metrics, you can hit our
API directly.

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

This section details Datadog's HTTP API. It makes it easy to get data in and
out of Datadog.

The Datadog API uses resource-oriented URLs, uses status codes to indicate the
success or failure of requests and returns JSON from all requests. Let's dive
in and see how it works.


<p class="alert alert-info">
  There are many <a href="/libraries/">libraries</a>
  that make it easier to interact with the Datadog API.

<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
All Datadog API calls must be authenticated. Requests that write data require
<em>reporting access</em> and must be authenticated with a valid API key. API
keys is passed as a query parameter:

<code>/api/v1/some/service?api_key=your_api_key</code>

Requests that read data require <em>full access</em> and must be authenticated
with a valid API key and an application key:

<code>/api/v1/some/service?api_key=your_api_key&application_key=your_application_key</code>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  You can manage your API and application keys on the <a
  href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api">account settings</a>
  page.

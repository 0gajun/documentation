## Overview
Unified service tagging ties Datadog telemetry together through the use of three standard tags, [reserved tags][1]: `env`, `service`, and `version`.

The environment variables `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` also form a single point of configuration for all telemetry emitted directly from your service's runtime: Traces, Logs, and Statsd metrics.

With unified service tagging, you can correlate related logs and traces by version of a service, trace a spike in CPU usage to corresponding areas of a service, and organize infrastructure more effectively.

## Requirements

- Unified service tagging requires knowledge of tagging and assigning tags. If you are unsure of how to configure tags, read the [Getting Started with Tagging][2] guide and [Assigning tags][3] documentation before proceeding to configuration.

- Unified service tagging requires setup of the [Datadog agent][4].

- This guide requires [Autodiscovery][5] for unified service tagging in a containerized environment.

## Recommendations

- If you're using [connected Logs and Traces][6], it is recommended to enable automatic logs injection. The APM tracer will then automatically add these fields to your logs, thereby eliminating manual configuration for those fields elsewhere.

## Configuration

### Containerized environment

In containerized environments, the Agent utilizes [Autodiscovery][5] to tag `env`, `service`, and `version` from standard labels and environment variables. Since the Agent associates data collected with specific containers, the configuration for the standard tags can conveniently reside within the container's metadata.

Additionally, the autodiscovered tags for `env`, `service`, and `version` are added to all data generated by [integration or logs checks]. You will not need to add these tags to each check's configuration.

##### Pod-level metrics
Add the following standard labels (`tags.datadoghq.com`) to the pod spec of a Deployment, StatefulSet, or Job.

```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tags.datadoghq.com/env: <ENV>
        tags.datadoghq.com/service: <SERVICE>
        tags.datadoghq.com/version: <VERSION>
```
These labels will cover pod-level Kubernetes CPU/Memory/Network/Disk metrics and will be used for injecting `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` into your service's container.

If you have multiple containers per pod, you can specify standard labels by container:

```yaml
tags.datadoghq.com/<container-name>.env
tags.datadoghq.com/<container-name>.service
tags.datadoghq.com/<container-name>.version
```

##### APM Tracer / Statsd client

[APM Tracer][11] and [statsd client][12] environment variables can be sourced from the same labels by using the [Kubernetes's downward API][13] in the format below:

```yaml
    containers:
    -  ...
       env:
            - name: DD_ENV
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/env']
            - name: DD_SERVICE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/service']
            - name: DD_VERSION
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/version']
```

##### State metrics

For [Kubernetes State Metrics][10], add the same standard labels to the collection of labels for the parent resource (e.g., Deployment).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    tags.datadoghq.com/env: <ENV>
    tags.datadoghq.com/service: <SERVICE>
    tags.datadoghq.com/version: <VERSION>
spec:
  <Block from above>
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Docker" %}}
To achieve a single point of configuration across all telemetry, make `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` available within your container's runtime environment. As long as the agent can access your container's [Docker socket][8], it will be able to detect the environment variables and map them to the standard tags.

If your service has no need for the DD environment variables (e.g., 3rd party software like Redis, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and applications not traced by APM), you can instead use Docker labels:

```yaml
  LABEL com.datadoghq.tags.env="<ENV>"
  LABEL com.datadoghq.tags.service="<SERVICE>"
  LABEL com.datadoghq.tags.version="<VERSION>"
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "ECS" %}}

To achieve a single point of configuration across all telemetry, make `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` available within your container's runtime environment. These variables can be set in the Docker image itself or in the ECS task's definition:

```yaml
        "environment": [
          {
            "name": "DD_ENV",
            "value": "<ENV>"
          },
          {
            "name": "DD_SERVICE",
            "value": "<SERVICE>"
          },
          {
            "name": "DD_VERSION",
            "value": "<VERSION>"
          }
        ]
```

If there are containers that will not benefit from using the environment variables in the application runtime, you can instead use Docker labels:

```yaml
        "dockerLabels": {
          "com.datadoghq.tags.env": "<ENV>",
          "com.datadoghq.tags.service": "<SERVICE>",
          "com.datadoghq.tags.version": "<VERSION>"
        }
```

### Non-containerized environments

#### Traces, Logs, Statsd metrics

The [APM tracer][7] automatically configures itself from the environment variable. [If enabled for logs injection][6], it will also inject `env`, `service`, and `version` into your logs.

If you already have logs configuration checks defined similarly to the example below, you **do not** need to define `service`:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: "/path/to/your/log.log"
    service: <SERVICE>
    source: python
    log_processing_rules:
      ...
    tags:
      ...
```

This configuration will allow existing configurations, such as log processing rules or other tags, to continue to work exactly the same.

If you do not wish to use automatic log injection from the APM tracer, you also have the option of [manually injecting these fields into logs][6].

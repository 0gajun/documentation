## Metrics

This section describes how send your application's custom metrics to Datadog.

- [DogStatsd](guides/metrics/): A metrics aggregration server bundled with the
  Datadog Agent.
- [Dogstream](guides/dogstream/): A log scraper built in to the Datadog Agent
- [API](api/): If you have our own source of metrics, post them directly to our
  API.

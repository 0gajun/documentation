Sometimes the amount of log events generated by your infrastructure is too large and fluctuates a lot, raising the issue of choosing which logs should be sent to a Log Management solution and which should be sent to an archive. But filtering your logs before sending them inevitably leads to gaps in coverage, and often filters out valuable data.

Datadog log management removes these limitations by decoupling log ingestion from indexing, which makes it possible to cost-effectively collect, process, and archive all your logs, this is called Logging without Limits*.

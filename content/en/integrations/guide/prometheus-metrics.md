If you are using Datadog's Prometheus or OpenMetrics checks, you may be interested in how these metrics map to existing Datadog metrics types. 

## Prometheus and OpenMetrics metric types

* `counter`: a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter, whose value can only increaseâ€”or be reset to zero.
* `gauge`: a metric that represents a single numerican value, which can arbitrarily go up and down.
* `histogram`: samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets; also provides a sum of all observed values.
* `summary`: similar to histogram; samples observations, provides a sum of all observed values, and calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.

## How they map to Datadog metrics

For more information about Datadog metric types, see the [Metric Types documentation][1].

### Counter

By default, Prometheus/OpenMetrics `counter` is mapped to Datadog's `gauge`.

However, if the parameter `send_monotonic_counter` is `true`, then this metric is sent as `monotonic_counter`.

### Gauge

Prometheus/OpenMetrics `gauge` maps to Datadog's `gauge`.

### Histogram

For Prometheus/OpenMetrics `histogram`, the `_count` and `_sum` values of the histogram are each mapped to Datadog's `gauge`.

If the parameter `send_histograms_buckets` is `true`, each `_bucket` value is also mapped to Datadog's `gauge`.

If the parameter `send_distribution_buckets` is `true`, each `_bucket` is mapped to Datadog's `distribution`.

### Summary

For Prometheus/OpenMetrics `summary`, the `_count` and `_sum` values of the summary are each mapped to Datadog's `gauge`.

If the parameter `send_distribution_buckets` is `true`, each `_bucket` is mapped to Datadog's `distribution`.

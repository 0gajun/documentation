Docker containers are supported in Pro and EnterpriseÂ plans. Pro subscriptions include 10 containers for each paid host. Enterprise subscriptions include 20 for each paid host. This container count is averaged across your entire infrastructure. Additional containers will be billed at $0.002 per container per hour. In addition, customers can purchase prepaid containers at $1 per container per month.

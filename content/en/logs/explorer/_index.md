The Logs Explorer is your home base for troubleshooting and exploration:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_explorer.png" alt="Explore view with comments"  >}}


In this view you can:

- [Build a context to explore your logs](#context).
- [Visualize your logs as a filtered Logstream or Log Analytics](#visualization).
- [Setup your log explorer view by creating facets and measure from your logs](#setup).
- [Share the content of your explorer view to another page within or outside of Datadog](#share-views).

## Context

Build up a context to explore your logs in your log explorer view first by selecting the proper time range then by using the search bar to filter your Logstream and Log Analytics.

### Time Range

The time range feature allows you to display logs in the Logstream or Log Analytics within a given time period.
It appears directly under the search bar as a timeline. The timeline can be displayed or wrapped up with the **Show timeline** check box in the Logstream option panel.

Quickly change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown:

### Search

Use facets, measures, tags, or even [free text search][1] to filter your Logstream and Log Analytics with dedicated context. The search bar and url automatically reflect your selections.

Follow the [guide to search your logs][1] for a detailed explanation of all the Log Explorer search features, including use of wildcards and queries of numerical values.

### Saved views

Use saved views to automatically configure your log explorer with a preselected set of facets, measures, searches, time ranges, and visualizations. Check the dedicated [saved views documentation][2] to learn more.

### Share views

Export your current log visualization with the _share_ functionality:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/send_view_to.png" alt="Send view to"  style="width:60%;">}}

Use the _share_ button to send your current log explorer view to a CSV file or team member, or create a monitor:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Log Search" %}}

| Export to CSV     | Export your current logstream view with its selected columns to a CSV file. You can export up to 5,000 logs at once.                           |
| Share View        | Share a link to the current view with your teammates through email, Slack, and more. See all [Datadog notification integrations][2] available. |

## Different Pages for Different Perspectives

Switch between the Log Search and the Log Analytics modes by clicking on the _Log Mode_ button in the upper left corner of the page:

### Log Lists
* The Log Search is the list of logs that match the selected context. A context is defined by a [search bar][1] filter and a [time range](#time-range).


### Log Patterns

Investigating large volumes of log data can be time consuming: you can spend hours on them and still understand only a fraction of them. However, applicative logs often look the same with some fraction of them varying. Datadog calls these _patterns_.

In the Log Explorer, patterns can be surfaced automatically to bring structure to the problem and help you quickly see what mattersâ€”exclude what's irrelevant.

Find out more in the [Log Patterns section][3]

{{< img src="logs/explorer/log_patterns.png" alt="Log Patterns"  style="width:70%;">}}


### Log Analytics

* After having gone through [Datadog processing][4], log parsing, and having [facets](#setup) and [measures](#setup) over the important attributes, you can graph log queries and see maximums, averages, percentiles, unique counts, and more. Follow the [log graphing guide][5] to learn more about all the graphing options.

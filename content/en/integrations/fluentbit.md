2. Update your [Fluent Bit configuration file][7] to add Datadog as an output plugin. For more information on the configuration parameters, see the [Configuration parameters table](#configuration-parameters). For an example `[OUTPUT]` configuration section, see the [Configuration file example](#configuration-file-example).
3. Once you start sending logs from Fluent Bit, verify the logs on the [Datadog Logs Explorer page][8].

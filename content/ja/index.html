**Not sure where to look?** Our documentation is split into guides and references. Guides explain how to
accomplish a particular task with Datadog, while the references are more general (as you might expect).
It might be a good idea to start with the [Datadog Overview](/overview/), which explains Datadog's
capabilities at a high level.

**If you have questions, we're here to help.** You can get in touch with
our support team by mentioning <a href="http://help.datadoghq.com/customer/portal/questions/913177--notification-in-datadog">@support</a> in a comment on Datadog itself, or by
[email](/help/#email), on [IRC](/help/#irc), or on our [customer service site](/help/#desk).

**Find a mistake in this documentation?** [Let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/DataDog/documentation/issues)
and we'll take care of it.

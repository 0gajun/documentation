title: Deploying the Datadog Agent to Azure
---

This guide assumes you are deploying an Azure Cloud Service using a [cloud service package](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/cloud-services/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-cloud-service/#deploy).
Also, at the moment, the Agent install requires .net framework 2.0 or 3.5.

### Install the Agent on instance startup

**Create** a file called `installDatadogAgent.cmd` with the following contents:

    powershell -c "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ddagent-windows-stable/ddagent-cli.msi\", \"ddagent.msi\")"
    msiexec /qn /i ddagent.msi APIKEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key found at [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api). 
The created file will download and install the latest version of the Agent on application deploy.


**Add** the installation task to your `ServiceDefinition.csdef` file by adding the following in the `<Startup>` section:

    <Task commandLine="installDatadogAgent.cmd" executionContext="elevated" />


### Deploy your app

You shold now repackage your app's cloud service package file (*.cspkg), making sure to include the `installDatadogAgent.cmd` file in the package.

On deploy you should see your new hosts appear on your infrastructure overview:

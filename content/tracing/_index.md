## What is APM?

Datadog APM provides you deep insight into your application's performance - from automatically generated dashboards monitoring key metrics such request volume and latency, to detailed traces of individual requests - side by side with your infrastructure monitoring.

Datadog APM is offered as an upgrade to our Pro and Enterprise plans. A free 14-day trial is available. Registered users can visit the [APM page of the Datadog application](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/home) to get started.


## Data collected

Datadog APM collects a variety of performance data at the service and endpoint level:

* Total request volume and rate
* Error volume and rate
* Latency (max, by percentile, overview of latency distribution)
* Apdex Score
* Distributed traces for individual transactions

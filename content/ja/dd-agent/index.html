<h2 id='title'>Graph application metrics with ease and style</h2>

Pup faithfully collects and displays metrics at localhost from StatsD. It's a hassle-free, open-source developer tool that comes bundled with the Datadog agent, meant to tighten the feedback loop on development.

<h2 id='install'>Install Pup with one quick command</h2>
<%= snippet_code_block "setup-pup.sh" %>

Note: Pup requires the 'sysstat' package on Linux.

That's it! Now navigate to <a href='http://localhost:17125'>http://localhost:17125</a>. Within ten seconds, system metrics should start streaming and you will see something like this:

To keep Pup up-to-date, simply re-run the install command.

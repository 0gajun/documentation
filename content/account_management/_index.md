## Account settings

The [account settings page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/profile) in Datadog allows you to control how you appear to others in your organization; switch or leave organizations; manage your notification preferences and more.

### Setting your profile

Your profile is how others in your organization will recognize you in Datadog. Set or update your name, email address and organizational role here. To update your picture, you will need to create an account on [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) and associate it with your email address.

If you log in to Datadog using Google authentication, your email address will be provided by your Google account and will *not* be editable within Datadog. To change your email address in Google, refer to the [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?hl=en).

### Managing your organizations

The account settings page also lists all of the organizations you are associated with. You can switch between these organizations from this page or by hovering over the account menu in the left-side navigation. Note that if you leave an organization, you will not be able to rejoin unless invited by an administrator in that organization.

To join an existing organization, you must be invited by an administrator. To request an invite:

1. Log out of Datadog by clicking the button on the [account settings page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/profile).
1. Visit the [new user sign up page](https://app.datadoghq.com/signup) and click the "Join an existing team" link.
1. Enter the email address associated with your Datadog account, your name, and the email address of an administrator in the organization you wish to join.
1. Click the "Request Invite" to submit the request. The organization administator will receive a notification with instruction on how to add you.

If you are an organization administrator, reference the additional documentation to:

* [Manage team members](/account_management/team)
* [Configure single sign on with SAML](/account_management/saml)
* [Rename your organization](/account_management/??)
* [Manage multi-account organizations](/account_management/multi_account)
* [Change your Datadog plan and view usage and billing history](/account_management/plan_usage_billing)

### Connecting to Github

If you have installed the [GitHub integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/github/) to create events in Datadog, you can link your personal GitHub account to your Datadog user account. By linking your accounts, any comments you post to GitHub events in Datadog will be automatically posted back into the corresponding issue or pull request in GitHub.

### Preferences

You can set your timezone, desktop notification, and email notification preferences from the Preferences tab within the account settings page.
